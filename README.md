# Aptly
Aptly is an apartment hunting tracker designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their apartment search process.  The project includes a comprehensive database that captures essential information about apartments, user preferences, listings, and scheduled tours.

## Purpose
Websites like Zillow and Redfin are great for finding apartments based on the different filters a user enters, but managing multiple listings across different platforms can be overwhelming. The Aptly database is designed for individuals actively searching for their next home, aiming to simplify the tracking and organization of potential rentals. Aptly will stand as a centralized platform which helps users do the following:
1. Organize Listings - Save and track apartments from various websites in one place.
2. Schedule and Manage Tours - Keep tours schedule organized and easily accessible for
rescheduling, if needed.
3. Prioritize Your Search - Review and compare saved listings to make informed decisions.
   
## Who is it for?
Aptly is primarily intended for individuals who are actively searching for places to rent/own. It will also be useful for real estate agents and property managers who want to track potential buyers and their interests.

## Type of Data
The database will store information about apartments, including property details like address, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, rent price, amenities, and the rental agent’s information. It will also store user information like name, email, address, preferred location, budget, and desired amenities. Aptly will track saves listings, including any comments and notes the user has, and schedules tours with respective dates and times.

## Why I’m Interested?
I've personally experienced the frustration of apartment hunting. It's a time-consuming and often stressful process. I've had to juggle multiple websites, schedule countless tours, and keep track of endless details. I believe Aptly can alleviate these pain points by providing a centralized platform to manage apartment searches, schedule tours, and keep track of important information. By simplifying the process, Aptly can help people find their perfect home more efficiently.
